# Water Quality Monitoring Device 💧🌿

This is a simple water quality monitoring device built using a **Raspberry Pi Pico**, basic sensors, and **sustainable materials** like **date pits** for filtration.

## 📌 Features
- Monitors basic water parameters (like TDS, turbidity, etc.)
- Uses low-cost, accessible components
- Promotes sustainable tech with reused date pits from local resources
- Designed for use in small communities or schools

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- Thonny
- Raspberry Pi Pico
- Analog sensors
- Experimental filtering setup using date pits

## 📁 Files
- `main.py`: main code for the device
- `sensor_readings.py`: functions for reading and formatting sensor data
- `test_data.csv`: sample output from testing
